  "description": "<p>On the list of things that Eric finds particularly odd, writing about himself in the third person is certainly up there near the top. That aside, he is particularly required excited to share some information about himself with you. In his formalized education, Eric has a B.A. in Music, an M.F.A. In Acting, and an M.Ed. In Elementary Curriculum and Instruction. His current research interests include how we teach elementary students to communicate both in person and over technology, reforming the methodologies for the teaching of systematic action research to pre-service teachers, and culturally responsive education practices through the lens of formalized prosody instruction. More than anything, though, he loves coffee, pizza and strawberry shortcake. Not together but... well now as he's typing this he wonders...</p><p><img src=\"/content/images/laurits_headshot_s.jpg\"></p><p>Eric has had a storied career spanning work in the performative and creative arts as well public education and reform. His past experiences include work with George Mason University, Fairfax County Public Schools, the Denver Center, the AmeriCorps, and the photography industry.</p>",
